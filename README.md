# A rental property listing app built using AWS

This is an app that's built using Next.js & Tailwind on the frontend, and AWS on the backend.

I decided to build my own REST API using AWS API Gateway, store URI's on DynamoDB, media files such as images of property listing on AWS S3 buckets, and all executes on serverless functions using AWS Lambda.

## Overview

The client fetches the data through the endpoint, lambda, fetch URI, fetch data, return data, cache data.
